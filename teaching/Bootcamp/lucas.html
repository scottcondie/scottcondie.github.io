<h2>The probability space<a class="headerlink" href="#the-probability-space" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We start with a state-space representation of the uncertainty in this model.</p>
<p>Suppose that there is a finite set <span class="math">\(Z\)</span> of possible states that can occur each period.  The state space is <span class="math">\(\Omega = Z^{\infty}\)</span>, the set of infinite sequences of elements of <span class="math">\(Z\)</span>.  So a particular state <span class="math">\(\omega \in \Omega\)</span> is a path <span class="math">\(\omega = (z_1,z_2,z_3,\ldots,z_t,\ldots)\)</span>.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Note</dt>
<dd>This is not the most general formulation of this problem, but will give all of the results that we need for our goals.  Specifically, the state-space representation we give can be generalized to an arbitrary probability space with a filtration that satisfies certain properties.</dd>
</dl>
<p>We will assume that many random variables are measurable with respect to the natural filtration generated by the space <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> at a particular time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Definition</dt>
<dd>A random variable <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is <em>measurable</em> with respect to the partition generated by <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> if whenever  <span class="math">\(\omega_{\tau}  = \omega'_{\tau}\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(\tau \le t\)</span>, <span class="math">\(x(\omega) = x(\omega')\)</span>.  That is, <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is measurable with respect to the partition generated by <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> if whenever two paths are identical up to time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, the random variable <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is the same across those two paths.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This property defines what can be known at any given time.  If we require a random variable to be measurable with respect to the time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> partition, we are saying that it can’t depend on things that happen after time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Example</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Let <span class="math">\(W = [1,2,3]\)</span>.  Consider two paths <span class="math">\(\omega = (1,2,3,\ldots)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\omega' = (1,2,1,\ldots)\)</span>.  Define the random variables <span class="math">\(x = \omega_1 + \omega_{2}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x' = \omega_1 + \omega_2 + \omega_{3}\)</span>.  These random variables take on the following values</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}x(\omega) &amp; = 3\\
x(\omega') &amp; = 3\end{split}\]</div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}x'(\omega) &amp; = 6 \\
x'(\omega') &amp; = 4\end{split}\]</div>
<p class="last">The random variable <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is measurable with respect to the partition generated by <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> at times <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, 2 and 3.  The random variable <span class="math">\(x'\)</span> is not measurable with respect to the partition generated by <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> at times 1 and 2, but is measurable with respect to the partition generated at time 3. <span class="math">\(x'\)</span> is not measurable with respect to the time 2 partition because <span class="math">\(\omega\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\omega'\)</span> are the same up to time <span class="math">\(2\)</span> and yet <span class="math">\(x'\)</span> assigned different values to these two paths.  Note that <span class="math">\(x\)</span>  is measurable with respect to the time 3 partition because the previous definition does not require that a random variable take on different values across paths that differ.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Definition</dt>
<dd>The sequence of partitions generated by <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> is called a <em>filtration</em>.</dd>
<dt>Definition</dt>
<dd>A sequence of random variables <span class="math">\((x^1,x^2,\ldots)\)</span> where each <span class="math">\(x^{\tau}\)</span> is measurable with respect to the partition generated by <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> at time <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span> is said to be <em>adapted to the filtration generated by</em> <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>A sequence of random variables adapted to the filtration generated by <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> has the property that its values at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> depend only on things that have happened up to time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>.  This is a property that we will require of most of the random sequences that we study.  So much so, that we use the notation <span class="math">\(x = (x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots)\)</span> to denote random variables that are adapted to the filtration generated by our space <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span>.</p>
<p>A probability distribution <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> is a function from the measurable sets into the real line.  For the kinds of models studied here, one can think of probabilities as mapping from <em>cylinders</em> of paths, which are sets of the form <span class="math">\(\{\omega: (\omega_{1}, \omega_{2}, \omega_{3}, \ldots, \omega_{t}) = (z_{1}, z_{2}, \ldots, z_{t}) \}\)</span>.  These probabilities will correspond to the probability of reaching a node on the event tree (in the definition above, the node whose first <span class="math">\(t\)</span> realizations are <span class="math">\((z_{1}, z_{2}, \ldots, z_{t})\)</span>.  Expectation of a random variable <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, given the partition <span class="math">\(\Omega_{t}\)</span> is then taken in the usual way,</p>
<div class="math">
\[Ex = \sum_{w \in \Omega_{t}} x(w)\mu(w)\]</div>
<p>If <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is adapted to the partition <span class="math">\(\Omega_{t}\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(x(\omega) = x(\omega')\)</span> for any <span class="math">\(\omega, \omega' \in w \in \Omega_{t}\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(x(w)\)</span> in the above expression is defined to be the value of <span class="math">\(x\)</span> along any path in the cylinder defined by <span class="math">\(w\)</span>.</p>

<h2>The Investor’s Problem<a class="headerlink" href="#the-investor-s-problem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Consider an investor who has preferences over her lifetime consumption that take the form</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-objective-function">
<span class="eqno">(1)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-objective-function" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[E\left [ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\beta^{t}u(c_{t}(\omega)) \right ].\]</div>
<p>This expectation is taken over the set of paths <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> and (as noted above) the random sequence <span class="math">\(c = (c_0,c_1,\ldots)\)</span> is assumed to be adapted to the filtration generated by <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span>.
The sequences <span class="math">\(\{c_{t}\}_{t=0}^{\infty}\)</span> are stochastic and depend on the realization of uncertainty and the investment choices of the individual in a way that will become clear.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Note</dt>
<dd>We will assume that <span class="math">\(u(\cdot)\)</span> is strictly concave so that <span class="math">\(E\left [ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\beta^{t}u(c_{t}(\omega)) \right ]\)</span> is also strictly concave.  This allows us to dispense with second order conditions.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The individual has access to assets labeled <span class="math">\(1,\ldots,N\)</span>.  Each asset <span class="math">\(n\)</span> pays a dividend <span class="math">\(d_{nt}\)</span> at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> that is also assumed to be stochastic and is paid in units of consumption at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>.  The investor starts at time 0 with shares of the assets given by <span class="math">\(\overline{\boldsymbol{\theta}_{0}} = \left ( \overline{\theta_{1}},\overline{\theta_{2}},\ldots, \overline{\theta_{n}} \right )'\)</span>.  Asset holdings at the end of time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> and the beginning of time <span class="math">\(t+1\)</span> are <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The prices of the assets at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> are given by <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{p}_{t} = (p_{1t},p_{2t},\ldots,p_{nt})'\)</span> (all vectors in these notes are assumed to be column vectors unless otherwise stated).  We assume that these prices are expressed in terms of units of the  consumption good available at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p>The budget constraint of the investor at time 0 is</p>
<div class="math">
\[c_{0} + \boldsymbol{p}'_{1}\overline{\boldsymbol{\theta}_{0}} = \boldsymbol{d'_{0}}\overline{\boldsymbol{\theta}} +  \boldsymbol{p'_{0}}\overline{\boldsymbol{\theta}}.\]</div>
<p>The budget constraint at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is given by</p>
<div class="math">
\[c_{t} + \boldsymbol{p}'_{t}\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t} = (\boldsymbol{d'_{t}} + \boldsymbol{p'_{t}}) \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t-1}.\]</div>
<p>Rewriting this we obtain the equation</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-budget-constraint">
<span class="eqno">(2)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-budget-constraint" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[c_{t} = \boldsymbol{d}'_t \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t} +  \boldsymbol{p}'_{t}\left ( \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t-1} - \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t} \right ).\]</div>
<p>Notice that all of the random variables (and random vectors) in the problem above depend implicitly on the realization <span class="math">\(\omega\)</span> and are assumed to be adapted to the filtration generated by <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span>.</p>
<p>After plugging the budget constraint in equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-budget-constraint">(2)</a> into the problem in equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-objective-function">(1)</a> we are left with the problem</p>
<div class="math">

<p>Consider the first order conditions for this problem with respect to <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t}\)</span>.  These are</p>
<div class="math">
\[E\left [\beta^t u'(c_t)\left(\boldsymbol{d}_t - \boldsymbol{p}_t \right )  + \beta^{t+1}u'(c_{t+1})\boldsymbol{p}_{t+1}    \right ] = 0\]</div>
<p>which can be simplified to</p>
<div class="math">
\[u'(c_t)\left(\boldsymbol{d}_t - \boldsymbol{p}_t \right )  + \beta E\left [ u'(c_{t+1})\boldsymbol{p}_{t+1} | \Omega_{t}    \right ] = 0.\]</div>
<p>Consider the row corresponding to asset <span class="math">\(i\)</span> of these vector Euler conditions.  It is</p>
<div class="math">
\[u'(c_t)\left(d_{i,t} - p_{i,t} \right )  + \beta E\left [ u'(c_{t+1})p_{i,t+1} | \Omega_{t}    \right ] = 0.\]</div>
<p>Solving this equation for the price of asset <span class="math">\(i\)</span> at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> we obtain the relationship</p>

<p>This fundamental relationship allows us to answer lots of questions about how the value of assets is determined.  We will look at this relationship in several different ways.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-stochastic-discount-factor-sdf">
<h2>The stochastic discount factor (SDF)<a class="headerlink" href="#the-stochastic-discount-factor-sdf" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let the adapted random variable <span class="math">\(m_{t+1}\)</span> be defined as</p>
<div class="math">
\[m_{t+1} = \beta \frac{u'(c_{t+1})}{u'(c_{t})}.\]</div>
<p>This sequence of random variables <span class="math">\(m = (m_{1},m_{2},\ldots)\)</span> is called the <em>stochastic discount factor</em> or SDF.  Notice that with this definition, equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-one-period-euler">(3)</a> can be written as</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-one-period-sdf">
<span class="eqno">(4)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-one-period-sdf" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[p_{i,t} = E[m_{t+1}(p_{i,t+1} + d_{i,t+1})|\Omega_{t}].\]</div>
<p>The SDF has intuitive meaning.  To understand it, lets first divide both sides of the previous equation by <span class="math">\(p_{i,t}\)</span> to get</p>
<div class="math">
\[1 = E \left [m_{t+1}\left (\frac{p_{i,t+1} + d_{i,t+1}}{p_{i,t}}\right )|\Omega_{t} \right].\]</div>
<p>Define the expression</p>
<div class="math">
\[R_{i,t+1} = \frac{p_{i,t+1} + d_{i,t+1}}{p_{i,t}}\]</div>
<p>covariance of <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> is <span class="math">\(cov(X,Y) = E(XY) - E(X)(Y)\)</span>.  Thus, we can rewrite equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-one-period-sdf">(4)</a> as</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-moment-condition">
<span class="eqno">(5)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-moment-condition" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[1 = cov(m_{t+1},R_{i,t+1}) + E[m_{t+1}|\Omega_{t}]E[R_{i,t+1}|\Omega_{t}]\]</div>
<p>Since the SDF is the ratio of marginal utilities, it is large in states next period when marginal utility is high compared to today.  Under standard assumptions of decreasing marginal utility, that means that the SDF is big in states where consumption is small. Likewise, in states where consumption is large, the SDF is small.  Therefore, the term <span class="math">\(cov(m_{t+1},R_{i,t+1})\)</span> will be large if <em>on average</em> the return to asset <span class="math">\(i\)</span> is large when marginal utility next period is large.  That is, <span class="math">\(cov(m_{t+1},R_{i,t+1})\)</span> will be large if on average the return to asset <span class="math">\(i\)</span> is high when consumption next period is low.  This result leads to the common practice in the literature of calling <span class="math">\(-cov(m_{t+1},R_{i,t+1})\)</span> the <em>risk</em> of asset <span class="math">\(i\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now consider the previous equation for asset <span class="math">\(j\)</span>.   Combining it with the equation for asset <span class="math">\(i\)</span> gives the relationship</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-i-j-comparison">
<span class="eqno">(6)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-i-j-comparison" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[cov(m_{t+1},R_{i,t+1}) + E[m_{t+1}|\Omega_{t}]E[R_{i,t+1}|\Omega_{t}] =   cov(m_{t+1},R_{j,t+1}) + E[m_{t+1}|\Omega_{t}]E[R_{j,t+1}|\Omega_{t}]\]</div>
<p>This demonstrates a fundamental relationship between the expected return to an asset and that asset’s covariance with the investor’s marginal utility.  Since the term <span class="math">\(E[u'(c_{t+1})|\Omega_{t}]\)</span> is common across assets <span class="math">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(j\)</span>, if asset <span class="math">\(i\)</span> has a higher expected return than asset <span class="math">\(j\)</span> then the investor will select a portfolio such that the covariance of asset <span class="math">\(i\)</span> with marginal utility (the SDF) is low.  That is, assets with high risk must also have high returns.  In other words, the individual will choose a portfolio where the expected return of each asset exactly compensates the trader for the risk born in holding the asset.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-risk-free-rate-of-return">
<h2>The risk-free rate of return<a class="headerlink" href="#the-risk-free-rate-of-return" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Using the SDF, we can calculate several things that are of interest.  Consider first the price of an asset that pays one unit of consumption next period in every state of the world.  Following that, the asset ceases to exist.  The price of that asset today will allow us to calculate the risk-free rate of return in this economy from period <span class="math">\(t\)</span> to period <span class="math">\(t+1\)</span>.  From equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-one-period-sdf">(4)</a>, the price today of such an asset would be</p>
<div class="math">
\[p_{i,t} = E[m_{t+1}|\Omega_{t}].\]</div>
<p>Thus, one unit of consumption tomorrow costs <span class="math">\(E[m_{t+1}|\Omega_{t}]\)</span> today.  Therefore, the (gross) risk-free rate of return today is</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-risk-free-rate">
<span class="eqno">(7)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-risk-free-rate" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[1 + r_{f} = \frac{1}{E[m_{t+1}|\Omega_{t}]}.\]</div>
<p>This relationship demonstrates the reason behind the name SDF.  The present value of one unit consumption tomorrow is</p>
<div class="math">
\[E[m_{t+1}|\Omega_{t}],\]</div>
<p>while in general the present value of any random payoff <span class="math">\(x\)</span> tomorrow is</p>
<div class="math">
\[p_{t} = E[m_{t+1}x|\Omega_{t}].\]</div>
<p>Armed with this definition, we can now reinterpret equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-i-j-comparison">(6)</a>.  Rewriting, this equation becomes</p>
<div class="math">
\[cov(m_{t+1},R_{i,t+1}) + \frac{E[R_{i,t+1}|\Omega_{t}]}{1+r_{f}} =   cov(m_{t+1},R_{j,t+1}) + \frac{E[R_{j,t+1}|\Omega_{t}]}{1+r_{f}}.\]</div>
<p>Expressions of the form  <span class="math">\(\frac{E[R_{i,t+1}|\Omega_{t}]}{1+r_{f}}\)</span> can now be interpreted as the <em>risk-premium</em> associated with asset <span class="math">\(i\)</span>.  That is, the expected return above the return that one would obtain for investing in a risk-free asset.  This equation then says that assets with high risk (assets for which <span class="math">\(-cov(m_{t+1},R_{i,t+1})\)</span> is small) will have high expected returns when the trader is holding an optimal portfolio.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exercises">
<h2>Exercises<a class="headerlink" href="#exercises" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>These exercises will give some familiarity with the GMM estimation of asset pricing models.
Assume that the joint distribution of <span class="math">\((m_{t+1}, R_{t+1})\)</span> is constant for all <span class="math">\(t\)</span> (this would occur, for example, if the stochastic process <span class="math">\(\omega\)</span> is Markov.)
Define <span class="math">\(m_{t+1} = \beta \frac{u'(c_{t+1})}{u'(c_{t})}\)</span> with <span class="math">\(u(c) = \frac{c^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma}\)</span>.  Download data on real personal consumption expenditures (FRED series PCECC96) and returns to the aggregate U.S. stock market (e.g. the Wilshire 5000 given in FRED series WILL5000INDFC) as well as the risk-free rate (FRED series GDPDEF, the GDP deflator, is one possible measure of inflation).  One possibility for data on the risk-free rate is the 3-month T-Bill rate given in FRED series TB3MS.  Note that you will need to transform the Wilshire 5000 series and the T-Bill series into quarterly data as well as calculate the real returns to the Wilshire 5000 by accounting for inflation.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Answer the following questions:</dt>
<dd><ol class="first last arabic simple">
<li>Assume that <span class="math">\(\beta = 0.99\)</span> (since this is quarterly data, this implies an annual risk-free rate of about 4%).  Calculate empirical analogs of the expected values and covariance in <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-moment-condition">(5)</a>.  Using <code class="code docutils literal"><span class="pre">scipy.optimize.broyden1</span></code>, solve for the value of <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> that leads to equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-moment-condition">(5)</a> holding.</li>
<li>How would you determine if this parameter is reasonable?</li>
<li>Now, consider the moment restriction given in equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-risk-free-rate">(7)</a>.  Continue to assume that <span class="math">\(\beta = 0.99\)</span>.  Estimate the <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> that generates the SDF using only this moment condition.  How does this <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> differ from the estimate of <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> found previously?</li>
<li>Finally, estimate <span class="math">\(beta\)</span> and <span class="math">\(gamma\)</span> using both equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-moment-condition">(5)</a> and equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-risk-free-rate">(7)</a>.  You will need to specify a weighting matrix (the identity matrix is a great place to start).  Plot the objective function for different <span class="math">\((\beta, \gamma)\)</span> pairs.
